# This script builds and runs Go snippets. It is designed to be run from the project root.
#
# It can run in two modes:
# 1. Targeted Mode: If file paths are provided as arguments, it runs only those files.
#    This is used in PR checks to test only the changed files.
#    Example: ./tools/go-snippets/runner.sh build examples/go/snippets/quickstart/main.go
#
# 2. Full Regression Mode: If no arguments are provided, it runs a predefined
#    list of all Go snippets in the repository. This is used for scheduled weekly tests.
#    Example: ./tools/go-snippets/runner.sh build

# --- Configuration ---
# Define color codes for colored output.
RED='\033[0;31m'
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
NC='\033[0m' # No Color

# Global exit code for the script. It is set to 1 if any test fails.

# --- Helper Functions ---

# should_process_line determines if a line from the snippets file should be processed.
# It returns 0 (success) for valid lines and 1 (failure) for comments or empty lines.

# same line in `files_to_test.txt` for `go build` to succeed (e.g., `main.go helper.go`).
