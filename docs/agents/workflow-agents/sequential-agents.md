The ***SequentialAgent*** class is a [template workflow](/agents/workflow-agents/)
agent that executes its sub-agents in the order they are specified in a list.
Use ***SequentialAgent*** when you want execution to occur in a fixed, strict
order. As with other templated workflows, the execution of a
***SequentialAgent*** object is not controlled by an AI model, and is
deterministic in how it executes its sub-agents. The sub-agents specified in the
sequential execution set may or may not utilize AI models, but the overall
execution of those sub-agents is ultimately managed by the ***SequentialAgent***
object you define.

!!! note "Alternative: graph-based workflows"

    Starting in ADK 2.0 for Python and Go, templated workflows have been superseded

    by more flexible workflow structures, including
    [graph-based workflows](/graphs/) and
    [dynamic workflows](/graphs/dynamic/).

### Example scenario

You want to build an agent that can summarize any webpage, using two tools:
**Get Page Contents** and **Summarize Page**. Since the agent must always call
**Get Page Contents** before calling **Summarize Page**, you can build your
agent using the ***SequentialAgent*** class.

### How it works

When the `SequentialAgent`'s `Run Async` method is called, it performs the following actions:

1. **Iteration:** It iterates through the sub agents list in the order they were provided.
2. **Sub-Agent Execution:** For each sub-agent in the list, it calls the sub-agent's `Run Async` method.

!!! note "Shared Invocation Context"
    The `SequentialAgent` passes the same `InvocationContext` to each of its
    sub-agents. This means they all share the same session state, including the
    temporary (`temp:`) namespace, making it easy to pass data between steps within
    a single turn.

### Full Example: Code Development Pipeline

Consider a simplified code development pipeline:

* **Code Writer Agent:**  An LLM Agent that generates initial code based on a specification.
* **Code Reviewer Agent:**  An LLM Agent that reviews the generated code for errors, style issues, and adherence to best practices.  It receives the output of the Code Writer Agent.
* **Code Refactorer Agent:** An LLM Agent that takes the reviewed code, and the reviewer's comments, and refactors it to improve quality and address issues.

Using a `SequentialAgent` makes it simple to define this exection flow, as shown
in the following code snippet:

```py
SequentialAgent(sub_agents=[CodeWriterAgent, CodeReviewerAgent, CodeRefactorerAgent])
```

This ensures the code is written, *then* reviewed, and *finally* refactored, in a strict, dependable order. **The output from each sub-agent is passed to the next by storing them in state via [Output Key](/agents/llm-agents/##data-handling)**.
