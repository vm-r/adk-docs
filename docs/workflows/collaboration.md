Some complex tasks may require multiple agents with specific responsibilities
and benefit from less structured procedures, particularly for iterative
processes with several, substantial sub-tasks. In a collaborative agent team in
ADK, a coordinator agent handles delegation of tasks to one or more subagents.
This approach makes it easier to build complex, self-managing agent systems,
with subagents defined to handle specific tasks, and automatic return to the
parent after completing a task.

When using this self-managed agent team approach, the subagents are assigned an
operating ***mode*** to manage their behavior and limit their scope of work.
These ***modes*** set general behavior guidelines for subagents and create more
predictable and reliable mulit-agent workflows. The following settings are
available for collaboration modes:

-   ***Chat***: Full user interaction, manual return to parent agent
    (default, current behavior)
-   ***Task***: User interaction for clarifications with automatic return to
    parent agent
-   ***Single-turn:*** No user interaction with automatic return and can be
    run in parallel

This guide covers how to use modes for your subagents and how these modes impact
agent behavior.

!!! warning "Disabled: Task mode in graph-based workflows"

    The collaborative mode `task` behavior is disabled for use in
    graph-based workflows in ADK Python v2.0.0. This feature
    is expected to be re-enabled in a future release.

## Get started

The following code example shows how to set operating modes for
a small team of subagents and assign them to a coordinator agent:

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from google.adk import Agent

    weather_agent = Agent(
        name="weather_checker",
        mode="single_turn",         # no user interaction
        tools=[get_weather, user_info, geocode_address],
    )
    flight_agent = Agent(
        name="flight_booker",
        mode="task",                # can ask user questions
        input_schema=FlightInput,
        output_schema=FlightResult,
        tools=[search_flights, book_flight],
    )
    root = Agent(
        name="travel_planner",      # coordinator agent
        sub_agents=[weather_agent, flight_agent],
        # Auto-injects delegation tools named after each subagent:
        # weather_checker, flight_booker
    )
    ```

=== "Go"

    In ADK Go v2.0.0, the `Mode` field on `llmagent.Config` accepts the same
    mode strings as Python: `"chat"`, `"task"`, and `"single_turn"`. Declaring
    `SubAgents` on the coordinator agent causes ADK to automatically generate
    a delegation tool for each subagent, named after the subagent itself,
    exactly as in Python.

    ```go
    --8<-- "examples/go/snippets/workflows/collaboration/main.go:get-started"
    ```

When you run this workflow, the `travel_planner` coordinator agent automatically
identifies and assigns tasks to the subagents. When a subagent completes
a task, it automatically returns to the coordinator agent.
For more information about structuring data using ***input_schema*** and
***output_schema*** with agents, subagents, and workflow nodes, see
[Data handling for agent workflows](/graphs/data-handling/).

## Mode configuration and behaviors

Each collaboration mode has specific behaviors and limitations associated with
it. The following table compares the attributes of a subagent configured with
each mode:

!!! warning "Caution: Mode only for subagents"

    The ***mode*** setting is intended specifically for use with subagents invoked
    by a coordinator parent agent. Do not configure a root agent with the mode
    setting.

    <tr>
      <th><strong>Topic \ Mode</strong></th>
      <th><code>chat</code> (default)</th>
      <th><code>task</code></th>

## Operating considerations

When using collaboration agent modes, there are a few control transfer and
context management considerations to consider, as described in the following
sections.

### Workflow Node and Agent transfers

Agents configured with ***task*** or ***single-turn*** modes can be used as
Workflow Agent graph nodes, and with ***LlmAgent*** instances. However the
execution transfer behavior is different depending on the calling, or parent,
agent:

**As a workflow graph node:** When a task or single-turn agent is placed within
a workflow graph — such as a ***SequentialAgent*** or ***ParallelAgent*** (Python
and Go prebuilt agents), or wrapped with `workflow.NewAgentNode` in the ADK Go
v2.0.0 graph engine — the agent executes its task. Upon completion, control
automatically advances to the next node based on the logic of the workflow
agent's graph.

**As a transferee from an LlmAgent:** When a parent ***LlmAgent*** transfers
control to a task agent via the delegation tool named after that subagent, the
task agent executes until it calls `finish_task`. At that point, control
automatically returns to the originating agent that initiated the transfer.
This behavior differs from default, chat ***mode*** agents, which require
explicit `transfer_to_agent` calls to hand back control.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>Invocation Context</strong></th>
      <th><strong>After Task Completion</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Workflow node</td>
      <td>Advances to next node in the graph</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Transfer from LlmAgent</td>
      <td>Returns control to the originating agent</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

This distinction allows the same task agent to be reused in both contexts
without modification. The runtime determines the appropriate control flow based
on how the agent was invoked.

### Agent context isolation

Each ***task*** or ***single-turn*** mode agent operates in its own isolated
session branch. When these agents operate in parallel, each agent only sees
events from its own branch when building context for AI model calls, and cannot
see what its peer agents are doing. Once all parallel branches complete, the
parent agent receives the collected results and can proceed.

## Known limitations

There are some known limitations with agent collaboration modes:

-   ***Task* mode agents** must be leaf agents and cannot have subagents.
